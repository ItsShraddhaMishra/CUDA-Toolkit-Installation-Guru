# Start with No CUDA/NVIDIA orphaned or corrupt Dependencies

* We start with purging existing Cuda/Nvidia Drivers.
* the cuda version is basically decided by which tensorflow version You want to install. /(I work with computer vision basically so I only know about tensorflow's incompatibility with wrong CUDA version.)/
* Go https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu to check which one You want.
* I journaled this repo for python==3.7 | tensorflow-gpu==2.4.1 | CUDA==11.0 | CUDNN==8.0 which is what I need. Sweety you choose Yours!

1. __Terminal:__ nvidia-smi
    * If returns Nothing : Good, Computer Doesn't Have NVIDIA-driver.
    * If Returns certain version, Check if it matches Your required CUDA version; Otherwise Purge.

2. sudo apt-get --purge -y remove 'cuda*'
3. sudo apt-get --purge -y remove 'nvidia*'
4. sudo reboot

5. __Terminal:__ nvidia-smi
    * it should return No Driver . Leave it here. 


Now, follow step 2 on 2. Installing CudaToolkit.
